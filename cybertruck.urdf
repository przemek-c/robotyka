Sure, here's a basic URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation of the Tesla Cybertruck. Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't include all the detailed specifications. URDF files are typically used to describe the visual and kinematic properties of robots or vehicles for use in robotics simulations. You might need to adjust this representation based on your specific needs.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="tesla_cybertruck">

  <!-- Link representing the main body of the truck -->
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="5 2 2"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <!-- Link representing the wheels -->
  <link name="wheel_front_left">
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="2.5 1 -1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.5" radius="0.4"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <!-- ... Define similar links for other wheels -->

  <!-- Joints connecting the wheels to the body -->
  <joint name="joint_front_left" type="continuous">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="wheel_front_left"/>
    <origin xyz="2.5 1 -1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
  </joint>

  <!-- ... Define similar joints for other wheels -->

</robot>
```

Remember that this URDF is a basic representation and doesn't capture all the details of the Tesla Cybertruck's design. You might want to enhance it with more accurate measurements, detailed visuals, collision geometries, and other specific features.
